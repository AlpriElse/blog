[00:00.00 -> 00:05.20] 20 minutes to midnight. The elevators are broken above the eighth floor so I'm forced down the stairwell
[00:05.20 -> 00:11.76] of my building. I have to get to Seattle Center but all I can think about is how all of this is an illusion.
[00:16.96 -> 00:21.68] Seattle at night is a different animal entirely. Like any other city after dark it's a
[00:21.68 -> 00:27.04] blood pumping living organism. The same buildings corners and streets a day but different
[00:27.04 -> 00:34.08] characters, storylines and tones at night. Especially under your zeep. 10 minutes to midnight.
[00:34.72 -> 00:39.12] I set out on first avenue the orange you have street lights illuminate patches of frigid street
[00:39.12 -> 00:45.68] that guide me closer and closer to the heart of downtown. Every year gyms are flooded with hopeful
[00:45.68 -> 00:50.48] prospects looking to reinvent their lives. Printers break under the heat of spitting out self
[00:50.48 -> 00:56.72] helpbooks and influencers the world over assure you the 24 hours from now. We'll bring a new year
[00:56.72 -> 01:04.32] and a new version of yourself. 5 minutes to midnight. A villain is blank at a fog and rolled off
[01:04.32 -> 01:09.76] the Olympic Peninsula covering all of Seattle and a blinding haze that obscured anything beyond 100
[01:09.76 -> 01:16.32] yards. Seattle Center couldn't be farther away from me and I don't know why but this night
[01:17.12 -> 01:23.12] seemed to bother me. In many ways and for some of us this night can feel like the
[01:23.12 -> 01:28.48] earliest moment of the year. A sludge of marketing and nostalgic scenes from cinema fled your
[01:28.48 -> 01:34.00] algorithm reminding you that you should have someone at midnight or be somewhere to embrace this
[01:34.00 -> 01:40.08] next version of yourself. I never bought into it but it doesn't mean I didn't want to.
[01:42.00 -> 01:46.80] I'd given up that I would make it to Seattle Center. It was cold and I found comfort in the
[01:46.80 -> 01:53.52] glow of the public market sign. A place that I've walked a hundred times but the night feels like
[01:53.52 -> 02:01.68] a different world. Hundreds of diverging storylines that are all bound for the same midnight
[02:01.68 -> 02:09.04] celebration. A date that started 2,000 years ago into Julius Caesar and since been adopted
[02:09.12 -> 02:17.84] the world over as the start of the New Year. But I can't help but think January 1st is all an illusion
[02:19.52 -> 02:25.36] because it is. The first of the year used to be March for the Persians, April for Mesopotamia,
[02:25.36 -> 02:29.92] July for the Egyptians, and the New Year was September for the Ancient Greeks.
[02:30.56 -> 02:35.92] Dates used for civic and agricultural resets, the end of harvest or the first new moon. Newer's
[02:35.92 -> 02:41.76] eve is an illusion of the highest order and see it's not that I don't want to be a new person
[02:41.76 -> 02:46.08] or reinvent myself like some Tyler Durd and Fever dream. It's that it doesn't matter.
[02:47.12 -> 02:49.52] And that's the best news of all.
[02:51.68 -> 02:55.20] It doesn't matter if you make that silly little video that your friends will laugh at
[02:55.76 -> 03:01.20] or approach that person you're afraid will reject you because years from now and you're old and
[03:01.20 -> 03:07.04] grey it's not the self-help books you'll be claiming to. It will be this. This moment
[03:07.60 -> 03:17.12] right here that you can't get back you'll think to yourself I should have just gone for you.
[03:32.16 -> 03:34.48] Where is my mind
[03:36.24 -> 03:37.50] My way
[03:39.66 -> 03:39.88] my
[03:40.88 -> 03:41.38] oh
